## src/api.js
Need to test line 76 and 77 where existing suites are combined when scraping permissions.

## src/errors.js
Seems that the NOtFound and Conflict constructors are never hit? This doesn't seem right...

## src/index.js
May as will test the constructor with a non-function for options.username.

## src/memory.js
Same thing here. Give it garbage in a quick test.
